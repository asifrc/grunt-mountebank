Contributing to grunt-mountebank
================================

I have a liberal attitude towards accepting pull requests.  If you have a good idea, I'll take it.

If you find a convenient way to test your change, go for it, but if not, I look to the
[mountebank](https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank) build to catch bugs in this plugin.
